### Hi there 👋

<!--
**ThiernoDiallo2018/ThiernoDiallo2018** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a passionate aspiring iOS Developer with a love for the Startup eco-system. 

🌱 Currently, I'm diving deep into UIKit with the hopes of learning SwiftUI down the line. 
🚀 I'm constantly exploring new technologies and finding ways to grow and contribute to the community.

When I'm not coding, you can find me working in the Venture Capital landscape. A big fan of learning and connecting with upcoming founders who are 
working on ground breaking technology. But, outside of work, you can find me Acting in shorts and off-broadway shows. 

### 🔧 Technologies & Tools
Here are some of the iOS technologies I plan on diving into:

- Augmented Reality: ARKit and RealityKit
- Machine Learning
- More to come....

### 📫 Let's Connect
