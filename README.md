#### Hey There 👋

I'm a passionate aspiring iOS Developer with a love for the Startup ecosystem. 

🌱 Currently, I'm diving deep into UIKit with the hopes of learning SwiftUI down the line. 
🚀 I'm constantly exploring new technologies and finding ways to grow and contribute to the community.

You can find me working in the Venture Capital landscape when I'm not coding. I am a big fan of learning and connecting with upcoming founders working on groundbreaking technology. But, outside of work, you can find me Acting in shorts and off-broadway shows. The link below that will lead to my acting site :)

### 🔧 Technologies & Tools
Here are some of the iOS technologies I plan on diving into:

- Augmented Reality: ARKit and RealityKit
- Machine Learning
- Python
- More to come...
